You Suck
HEY
Nobody likes you, you're ugly and your mother dresses funny
How did you get here? Did someone leave your cage open?
I'd slap you, but that would be animal abuse
You are so old, even your memory is in black and white.
You are proof that evolution CAN go in reverse.
I look into your eyes and get the feeling someone else is driving.
I love what you've done with your hair. How did you get it to come out of one nostril like that?
You are so old, the candles on your birthday cake raised earth's temperature by 3 degrees.
You are so dumb, you planted a dogwood tree and expected a litter of puppies.
Your house is so dirty you have to wipe your feet before you go outside.
