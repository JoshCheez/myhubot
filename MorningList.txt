may your day be filled with random outbursts of infectious giggles!
Every day is a good day to be alive whether the sun's shining or not.
Be willing to be a beginner every single morning.
Morning is nature's way of saying: "Live life one more time, make a difference, touch one heart, encourage one mind and inspire one soul."
Start your day with a smile & lots of joy in your heart. Be positive that everything will be ok & full of happiness.Have a wonderful day 2 all.
Morning is a wonderful blessing, either cloudy or sunny. It stands for hope, giving us another start at what we call life. Have a good morning!

Every morning take a good look at yourself in the mirror and say " I am going to have a great day! Yes I can do it, and I will let nobody steal my joy!
A new day brightens memories of yesterday and promises moments that will sparkle today.
Arise and shine… Today is your day to follow your dreams and succeed in pursuing your goals.
Always believe that something good is about to happen. Start right in the morning and have a great day!
A sweeter smile, a brighter day, hope everything turns out great for you Today!
In my dreams I create a beautiful morning for you and then I share this beautiful dream as my heartfelt wish.
I think of you and a smiling face i always visualize, wishing you is a happy act to see my thoughts realize.
Morning is wonderful. Its only drawback is that it comes at such an inconvenient time of day
My idea of a morning that is good is one when I open my eyes, take a deep breath, then go back to sleep.
